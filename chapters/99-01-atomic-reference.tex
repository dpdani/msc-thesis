\chapter{Atomic Reference}\label{ch:atomic-reference}

We present in this Appendix an atomically updatable reference to a Python object.
That is, a reference that can be safely updated in spite of concurrent changes and deallocations.

This was initially implemented in order to correctly handle the swapping of an \texttt{AtomicDict}'s internal metadata object, in a way that made use of CPython's new QSBR scheme.
(See Section~\ref{subsec:migration-phases}, when the leader thread swaps the metadata object.)
Its usefulness extends beyond the internal structures of \texttt{AtomicDict}: since the problem solved is very simple, its applications can be numerous.

The implementation described in this Appendix is publicly available at~\cite[src/cereggii/atomic\_ref.c]{cereggii}.


\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

The design of \texttt{AtomicRef} closely resembles the interface of Java's \texttt{Atomic\-Reference}: an \texttt{AtomicRef} object stores a single pointer to another CPython object.
The choice of following the Java interface comes down to two considerations: programmers who are already accustomed to Java's interface need not learn a new one, and this being such a relatively simple problem, it would seem hard to design something completely different from the rest of the world.
(Regarding the slight name difference: the shortened \emph{ref} is more commonly used in Python, compared to \emph{reference}, in several parts of the language.)

The ``hard'' part of this design is to correctly use free-threading CPython's QSBR scheme.
(See Section~\ref{sec:qsbr} for an introduction to QSBR.)
Namely, in lines 23--25 of Listing~\ref{lst:atomic-ref} the read on line 24 is retried until the reference count increment succeeds on line 25.
This is where serious bugs may occur in a faulty implementation.
In fact, if incorrectly using QSBR, instead of failing a call to increment the reference count, it is possible that the memory pertaining to the fore-referenced object is freed, as that would be the effect of a concurrent \texttt{Decref} which sees the reference count reach 0.
The exhibited behavior would thus be a segmentation fault, instead of an increase in the running time (due to contention).
A significantly worse possibility.

    } AtomicRef;

    int AtomicRef_CompareAndSet(self, expected, new)
    {
      Incref(new);
      int success = CompareAndSet(&self->reference, expected, new);
      if (success) {
        Decref(expected);
        return 1;
      } else {
        Decref(new);
        return 0;
      }
    }

    PyObject *AtomicRef_Get(self)
    {
      PyObject *reference;
      do {
        reference = self->reference;
      } while (!TryIncref(reference));
      return reference;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Single-Field Struct}\label{subsec:single-field-struct}

An alternative design approach could have been not making \texttt{AtomicRef} a CPy\-thon object.
Instead, it would be turned into a single-field C struct, essentially removing line 2 of Listing~\ref{lst:atomic-ref}.
This design change was inspired by the new \texttt{PyMutex} of the original nogil fork, and of Python 3.13t.

This choice would slightly help the performance of \texttt{AtomicDict} as well, given that there are currently two indirections required to read the metadata object: one indirection to read \texttt{{dict->metadata}}, which is an \texttt{AtomicRef *}, and one indirection to read \texttt{{dict->metadata->reference}}, which is the actual \texttt{AtomicDict} metadata object.
Ipso facto, as an improvement for \texttt{AtomicDict} it would be very marginal.
Instead, if a user of this library would necessitate to manage several instances of \texttt{AtomicRef}, say, stored into a C array, access to each referenced object would be hindered by the double indirection.
Furthermore, \texttt{AtomicRef} not being a Python object would entail that it would not be possible to expose this presented functionality into Python code.

It is possible to both gain further performance, and retain usability in Python code: using a single-field C struct for \texttt{AtomicRef}, as previously described, intended to be accessed from C code, and also implementing a differently named Python type, say \texttt{AtomicRefObj}.
The new Python type would itself be the container for a single-field C struct \texttt{AtomicRef}, thus essentially retaining equal functionality as the one presented before.


\section{Issues with free-threading CPython 3.13}\label{sec:issues-with-free-threading-changes-and-proposed-re-implementation}

During an exchange with Gross, he pointed out that the method employed for correct concurrent handling of reference counts differed in Python 3.13t, compared to his original \texttt{nogil} fork.
Namely, that the \texttt{TryIncref} routine would not behave in the same way.
Instead, expecting the object to be in the \emph{weakrefs} state, described in Section~\ref{sec:concurrent-biased-reference-counting}.
In order to correctly implement \texttt{AtomicRef} for Python 3.13, it will therefore become necessary to enforce that the objects referenced by an \texttt{AtomicRef} to be at least in the \emph{weakrefs} state.
The state transition needs to be carried out before a new reference is stored inside \texttt{AtomicRef}, i.e.\ before another thread may decrement the reference count, and then deallocate the object without using the QSBR slow path for deallocation.
Upon applying this modification, it is expected that the current implementation will restore correctness, without compromising the overall design.
